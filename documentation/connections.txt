    HANDSHAKE
    
        Start the Relay server on port X. Port X is used for administration and communications incoming from the minecraft server.
        
        Start the Server component. Server component connects to the Relay component: X to register itself and exchange all the data.
        
        Start the Minecraft server.
        
        Users connect to the Relay. The Relay will send all the data to the Server component multiplexed in a custom format, and the Server component will create several local TCP connections to the Minecraft server.
        
        Responses will go similarly through the multiplexed channel.
